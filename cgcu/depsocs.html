                Welcome all fellow Bioengineers to the prestigious Bioengineering Society! As members of the
                department, you are automatically members of the society, and boy are you in for a treat!
                The Bioengineering Society has grown from strength to strength since its founding and has

            </p>
            <p>
                Our objectives are to help students fully explore their career opportunities, raise commercial
                interest in Bioengineering students within industry and research, and, last but not least, to
                further strengthen social relations amongst all members of our society by organising and subsidising
                events for Bioengineering students and staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The society holds several events throughout the year, from socials to careers and academic events.

                Welcome to Imperial, and as an undergraduate of Chemical Engineering you’re already a member of
                one of the most thriving and active societies Imperial has to offer: ChemEng Soc.
            </p>
            <p>
                What separates us from other societies is the number and quality of independent events we offer
                for only you and your course-mates. We offer a range of formal events such as the Fresher’s
                and Annual Dinner in prestigious locations as well as more light-hearted but highly enjoyable
                events such as our famous talent show, featuring some of the top talent the ChemEnger’s have
                to offer with previous acts including rapping, stand-up comedy and even the lecturers getting
                their rave on to Gangnam Style and Shake it Off! Other events include the college-wide coveted
                Cocktail Party and the notorious Frank Mortons Sports day, an event in which each ChemEng Dept.
                across the country competes in a festival of sport followed by a huge bar crawl and club night.
            </p>
            <p>
                ChemEng at Imperial is one of the highest rated departments in the world and as such are
                students are highly sought-after by employers, evidenced by the talks from companies such as
                Shell, P&G, ExxonMobil and many more that you will be experiencing.

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
                CivSoc is the society for students of the Civil Engineering Department, all of whom become
                members of the society automatically. Our society is one of the most active departmental societies,
                providing a support network (and basically a family) for all our students as we battle through our
                degree together!
            </p>
            <p>
                We have an ever-expanding variety of events on offer, from the intellectual and sporting to the
                good old fashioned pub crawls and bar nights, all with the purpose of enhancing your experience
                at Imperial and helping you to create some lifelong friendships, with people from all the year
                groups. The highlight of the CivSoc calendar is the International Tour, which is the envy of all
                other departments, giving students the opportunity to travel to another country. There we
                experience their university life, engineering practice, local cuisines and many other
                cultural delights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from our events, we also have very strong links to industry and regularly have speakers
                coming into the department to promote their companies, or even to try and recruit people.

            <p>
                As the social side of the Department of Computing, DoCSoc makes it our mission to prove that all
                those long hours in labs and lectures are worth it after all!
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep you on your toes, we run a wide variety of events, from tech talks to programming
                competitions and visits to industry. There’s also Imperial’s famous annual hackathon, IC Hack,
                where anyone and everyone who loves invention can gather to build some really cool tech, all in
                just 24 hours. It’s not all about ones and zeroes though - we also organise a plethora of fantastic
                social events every year! Last year we ran an IMAX cinema night, countless free bar nights over in
                the Union, and a spectacular ball at Kensington Roof Gardens, to name just a few. Best of all, our
                events are subsidised generously by our sponsors so you never have to worry about the cost!
            </p>
            <p>
                DoCSoc is run by DoC students, for DoC students, although anyone with an interest in computing can
                take part. We want to make your time at Imperial as enjoyable and rewarding as we can,
                so come and get involved!

                Welcome to Imperial! As a freshman of Design Engineering and the Dyson School you are
                automatically a member of DesSoc.
            </p>
            <p>
                DesSoc is a departmental society run especially for Design Engineering students. We are dedicated
                to providing our members with extracurricular and social events to further broaden their experience
                whilst they study at Imperial and foster a sense of community in the department.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important jobs we do each year is to organise the Mums and Dads initiative run by
                most departments across Imperial. All freshmen will be contacted about the initiative before the
                start of term. The scheme will match you with two parents (second year Des Eng students) as well
                as a fresher siblings. Throughout the year we will run ‘Family’ events to help integrate all the
                freshmen into the DesEng family.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the initiative we run a variety of events all year such as bar nights, pub crawls,
                dinners (including the end-of-year party), film nights, football, quiz nights and professional
                talks from links to alumni and industry. We’re also planning on bringing bigger events and even a
                DesSoc trip as our school gets bigger! We hope you have a fantastic year.

                MechSoc is open and free to anyone in college, and everyone studying Mechanical Engineering is
                auto-enrolled, making up the majority of our society.
            </p>
            <p>
                We offer many formal events such as career talks, networking events and site tours with industry,
                not limited to just engineering companies. There are also going to be many informal sociable events
                such as inter-soc sport tournaments, day trips out and cocktail party.

            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you’re up for some casual semi-competitive sports and looking for internships for the summer
                then MechSoc is for you!
