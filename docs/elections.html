            <h3>Vice President (Activities)</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">
            <p>
            Being Vice-President (Activities) is a commitment to showcasing the City and Guilds College Union. The events you will organise will be the most visible side of the actions led by CGCU, they are the face of the Union, what people see and remember. From formal dinners to club nights to sports-days, you can let your imagination take control to come up with the best events.
            </p>

            <p>
            The role gives you a substantial amount of autonomy to organise events that you believe will please your fellow engineers, and it doesn’t even require much – if any – experience. Two major attributes are necessary though; you must be fairly outspoken and believe in what you want. But do not fear, if you want to do this, you can; whoever you are. This role requires planning events for Fresher’s week over the summer, so be ready to help around during September.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container page-subtitle" id="dwo">
            <h3>Deputy Welfare Officer</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
            As Deputy Welfare Officer, you will work with the Welfare Officer to represent the non-academic concerns of all undergraduate engineering students, whatever those concerns may be. An understanding of the personal issues faced by students across all sections of the community is important for the role. This should include, but is not limited to: sexual assault and consent issues, sexual health, mental health, perceived pressures/expectations, LGBT+ representation, or any other topical issue arising during your tenure: it’s important to keep your finger on the pulse of what students are concerned about.
            </p>

            <p>
            While the Welfare Officer must sit on Union Council and the Community and Welfare Board, you will be able to help organise campaigns, events and co-ordinate the CGCU’s welfare strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
            To reassure students who may seek advice with personal matters is an important responsibility. Signposting to support services, internal and external, is crucial – you cannot be a counsellor!
            </p>

            <p>
            Promoting welfare issues to the student body is another key aspect of the role. You have a lot of potential to run a variety of events, but will be limited by time. Consider key campaigns or events you’d like to run, as well as collaborating with the Union’s Deputy President (Welfare) to maximise lasting positive impact on the college. Everyone loves feel-good events, but a legacy of changing attitudes and cultures is a much more exciting prospect, within the reach of your role!
            </p>

            <p>
            Don’t be overwhelmed by the wide scope of ‘welfare’! You’ll have a handover, as well as the support of brilliant union staff at your fingertips. Bring your enthusiasm, a never-give-up attitude and believe in the difference small, good actions can make, and you’ll make a great Deputy Welfare Officer!
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container page-subtitle" id="aao">
            <h3>Academic Affairs Officer</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
            At the heart of CGCU, the AAO’s role is to solve academic issues and help to improve teaching standards across the Faculty of Engineering, working closely with Dep Reps and Faculty staff. The role also includes constant communication with the Deputy President (Education) to ensure that the Faculty of Engineering is heading in the right direction compared to other Faculties. This role will be great for you if you have had previous experience of student academic representation and now feel keen to widen your perspective from your Department to the entire Faculty. As CGCU AAO you will go to the Faculty Teaching Committee meetings, Faculty Education Committee meetings and Student-Staff departmental meetings each term. In addition to this you will also sit on the Education and Representatives Board, Union Council and the CGCU Exec Committee which meet more frequently.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container page-subtitle" id="so">
            <h3>Sports Officer</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
            The Sports Officer role is a fun and enjoyable one. The responsibilities are much lower than when compared to some of the other roles, but this does not mean that people do not take you seriously. You have a say in many of the happenings within the CGCU and you are offered the chance to make a difference. This role is perfect for either a final year who wants to have a say in how the Guilds works, or for a second or third year, who wants some experience before running for a major position within the Guilds.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container page-subtitle" id="rag">
            <h3>RAG Officer</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
            RAG Co-ordinator is responsible for liaising with IC RAG. Its job is to create exciting and interesting events for the CGCU and raise money for charity. This is a very important role and will be involved in high profile events such as Prison Break, Lost and mascotry. This year CGCU RAG has been the best it has been for years, and we would like this to continue.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container page-subtitle" id="mmo">
            <h3>Media and Marketing Officer</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="container well white-bkg">

            <p>
            The role of the Media &amp; Marketing Officer is to manage and care for the City & Guilds College Union as a brand and identity within Imperial College London. Whether that means maintaining the CGCU’s presence within social networks, producing posters and leaflets or designing the Freshers’ Handbook, this role requires a dash of creativity. So if you think you have the potential to drive the CGCU’s publicity machine and an eye for design then sign up to be next year’s Media and Marketing Officer!
