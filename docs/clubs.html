                Imperial have a huge and diverse number of clubs and societies to offer to students. The clubs
                featured here are specifically under the City & Guilds umbrella, focusing on engineering,
                technology and sport.

                Engineering Challenge is a student-led charity aiming to facilitate human development through

            </p>
            <p>
                This year will be an exciting year, filled with hands on activities, outreach opportunities,
                socials (in particular our popular camping tour!) and our newest venture: a new international
                development project in the Philippines. If you want to get involved, come meet us at our freshers

            <p>
                Imperial College Robotics Society aims to bring all roboticists, hackers, makers and general
                tinkerers together under one roof. We meet regularly to share ideas, help each other out and get
                to work on a huge number of very cool projects. The projects are related to both hardware and software.
                Everything from drive train design to custom FPGA implementations; PCB design to algorithm development
                - everybody is catered for!
            </p>
            <p>
                The society gets involved in a number of interesting competitions from small one-day computer
                security challenges to large robotics tournaments that take months to prepare for. Further to this
                we organise a wide and varied range of courses, all relating to the areas of robotics and electronics,
                run by enthusiastic members of the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you fancy getting involved, find us in the level 5 Electronic Engineering labs on Wednesday
                afternoons (though many of us practically live there, so any time really).

                C&G Motor Club aims to provide a range of motor related activities at rock bottom prices and
                accessible to everyone, regardless of experience. We run regular karting trips to indoor and
                outdoor tracks all over the country, both with hire karts and our own  eet of powerful,
                race-worthy karts (up to 80mph!!!). We also offer all members the opportunity to compete in our
                teams in the British Universities Karting Championship (BUKC) against over 100 universities
                around the UK, in what may be the most exiting league of close motor racing you will ever encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club runs weekly Wednesday afternoon sessions (in the garage on Unwin Road), where we can be
                found maintaining our karts and driving around in our very own road legal Classic Mini.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many past members have gone on to top roles in motorsport, including F1. Whether you’ve never
                previously driven, or a keen racer, C&G Motor Club caters for all. No previous mechanical
                knowledge is needed. All that we ask is for you to turn up with enthusiasm!

                Hi, we are Imperial College Railway & Transport Society, Railsoc for short. Everyone is welcome,
                even if you don’t know your class 57s from your 66s - train knowledge is absolutely not compulsory.
                Railsoc is so much more than just that!
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many opportunities to get into the transport sector here and abroad for engineers,
                as Railsoc boast some great industry links, for example Bombardier. If you just want to have some
                good old train related fun, we have some fantastic events lines up. Join us in Welvomr Week for the
                Orbital trail, and later in the year for our annual tracklaying weekend in Porthmadog, Wales.
                We are planning visits to the Brunel Museum, and socials in transport themed bars and pubs
                amongst other events. This is really just the tip of the iceberg! Join our mailing list and
                sign up to our society - membership is FREE this year, you lucky things. See you all soon and
                enjoy Imperial.

                ICSEDS is Imperial’s space society. We are Students for the Exploration and Development of

                you can teach us. We work on real space projects, designing, building, and launching everything from
                rockets and balloons, to rovers and ramjets. We also run trips and events, and do outreach in
                conjunction with UKSEDS and the UK Space Design Competition. We are a branch of UKSEDS, the UK’s
